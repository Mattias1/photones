Functional Game Programming in F#
=================================

This is an endeavour in writing an interesting and well performing game in a functional way.
[Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
is a programming paradigm that is not frequently used to create games.
Nonetheless it is an interesting paradigm, and as such worth exploring in this setting.

F# seems to be a logical choice here. It allows for imperative programming and mutation when the need
arises, but still very much encourages a functional style.
The libraries [awgraphics](https://github.com/amulware/awgraphics)
and [beardgame utilities](https://github.com/beardgame/utilities) provide lean .NET wrappers around
OpenGL/OpenTK for game programming in .NET.
